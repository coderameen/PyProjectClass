#Optimizer: Optimer is an Algorithm used to minimize the loss function during the  training of Neural Network

#Brief: while traing image in ANN, There are lot of un-recognized features lead to miss classify the prediction inreturn tends to predict inaccuratly and false output. To reduce Loss Function we use optimizers

'''
Types of optimizers:
1.Gradient Descent optimizer
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer
3.Adam Optimizer(Adoptive Moment Estimation)
4. AdaGrad optimizer

#LOSS FUNCTION: It is used to measure how good the neural network model perform a certain task

#To measure loss function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
